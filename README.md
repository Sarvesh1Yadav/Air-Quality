# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) range and numerical AQI values based on various air pollutant measurements. It utilizes machine learning models for both classification (predicting AQI range) and regression (predicting AQI value).

## 🛠️ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AQI-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AQI-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
